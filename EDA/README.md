# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python

## Introduction 

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a method of analyzing datasets to understand their main characteristics, beyond the formal modeling and thereby contrasts traditional hypothesis testing. 
It involves summarizing data features, detecting patterns, and uncovering relationships through visual and 
statistical techniques. 

### Data Pre-processing and Feature Engineering
Data pre-processing involves filtration and preparing raw data before it is analyzed to facilitate deature engineering. 

Feature Engineering refers to the process of using domain knowledge to selecta and transform the most relevant variables from raw data when creating a predictive model using machine learning or statistical modeling. The goal of feature engineering and selection is to improve the performance of machine learning algorithms.

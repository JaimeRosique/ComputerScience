## Gradient Descent

Gradient Descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the cost function in machine learning models. It iteratively adjusts the parameters of the model to find the minimum value of the cost function.

- **File**: `gradient_descent.ipynb`
- **Description**: Implementation of gradient descent algorithm for linear regression.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Learning Rate
  - Cost Function
  - Convergence

## Dimensionality Reduction

Dimensionality reduction is a technique used to reduce the number of features in a dataset while retaining as much information as possible. It is useful for visualization, reducing computational cost, and mitigating the curse of dimensionality.

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

PCA is a linear technique for reducing the dimensionality of a dataset by transforming the data to a new set of variables that are uncorrelated and ordered by the amount of variance they capture from the original dataset.

- **File**: `pca.ipynb`
- **Description**: Implementation of Principal Component Analysis.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
  - Covariance Matrix
  - Variance Explained

### Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)

LDA is a supervised dimensionality reduction technique that finds the linear combinations of features that best separate two or more classes of data.

- **File**: `lgm.ipynb`
- **Description**: Implementation of Linear Discriminant Analysis.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Scatter Matrices
  - Fisher's Criterion
  - Class Separability
 
## Linear Generative Models 

Linear generative models assume that data is generated from a linear combination of variables. These models are useful for classification and dimensionality reduction tasks. The two main models discussed in this repository are Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA).

### Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)

LDA is a supervised dimensionality reduction technique that finds the linear combinations of features that best separate two or more classes of data.

- **File**: `lgm.ipynb`
- **Description**: Implementation of Linear Discriminant Analysis.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Scatter Matrices
  - Fisher's Criterion
  - Class Separability

### Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB)

Gaussian Naive Bayes is a generative learning algorithm that assumes the features are normally distributed. It is called "naive" because it assumes that all features are independent given the class.

- **File**: `gnb.py`
- **Description**: Implementation of Gaussian Naive Bayes.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Bayes' Theorem
  - Gaussian Distribution
  - Feature Independence

### Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)

QDA is a generative model that assumes each class has a Gaussian distribution with its own covariance matrix. Unlike Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), which assumes a common covariance matrix for all classes, QDA allows for different covariance matrices for each class, resulting in a quadratic decision boundary.

- **File**: `qda.py`
- **Description**: Implementation of Quadratic Discriminant Analysis.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Gaussian Distribution
  - Covariance Matrix
  - Bayes' Theorem
  - Quadratic Decision Boundary

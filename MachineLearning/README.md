## Gradient Descent

Gradient Descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the cost function in machine learning models. It iteratively adjusts the parameters of the model to find the minimum value of the cost function.

- **File**: `gradient_descent.ipynb`
- **Description**: Implementation of gradient descent algorithm for linear regression.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Learning Rate
  - Cost Function
  - Convergence

## Dimensionality Reduction

Dimensionality reduction is a technique used to reduce the number of features in a dataset while retaining as much information as possible. It is useful for visualization, reducing computational cost, and mitigating the curse of dimensionality.

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

PCA is a linear technique for reducing the dimensionality of a dataset by transforming the data to a new set of variables that are uncorrelated and ordered by the amount of variance they capture from the original dataset.

- **File**: `pca.py`
- **Description**: Implementation of Principal Component Analysis.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
  - Covariance Matrix
  - Variance Explained

### Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)

LDA is a supervised dimensionality reduction technique that finds the linear combinations of features that best separate two or more classes of data.

- **File**: `lda.py`
- **Description**: Implementation of Linear Discriminant Analysis.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Scatter Matrices
  - Fisher's Criterion
  - Class Separability
